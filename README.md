## 1. Introduction üöÄ

DAIA is a cutting-edge AI agent designed to enhance your productivity by intelligently interacting with your computer and completing big goals. With DAIA, you can complete goals, automate tasks, gather information, and perform various operations seamlessly, just like you would do yourself.

The main difference with the DAIA compared to other AI Agents is that it interacts with your computer through a vision system (GPT-4V) and task completion system allowing it to be capable of doing many more tasks and goals compared to other AI Agents that use the Terminal or CMD for interaction with the computer.
Furthermore, the DAIA will be built with a built-in memory, self-evaluating and optimizing system from the start.

Here is our current blueprint for the DAIA and its features:

- **Endless Scalability**: DAIA can make multiple copies of itself and create its own network of DAIAs provided the computing power. (in progress)

- **Automation of Big Goals**: DAIA can automate big goals with its capability to make multiple versions of itself, therefore making the process faster. (in progress)

## 3. Usage ü§ù

1. Install the DAIA by running `git clone https://github.com/Envedity/DAIA.git` in your desired path, or by downloading and extracting the zip file.
2. Make a python 3.11 env using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the DAIA.py file by typing `python DAIA.py` in the DAIA directory.
4. Choose a version of the DAIA you want to use.
5. Give it a goal.
6. Let it know if you agree with what it suggests for goal compleation.
7. Sit back and let the DAIA compleate your goal all by itself

## 4. Contribution üôå
