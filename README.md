## 1. Introduction 🚀

DAIA is a cutting-edge AI agent designed to enhance your productivity by intelligently interacting with your computer and compleating big goals. With DAIA, you can complate goals, automate tasks, gather information, and perform various operations seamlessly, just like you would do yourself.

The main difference with the DAIA compared to other AI Agents is that it interacts with your computer trough a vision system (GPT-4V) and task compleation system allowing it to be capable of doing many more tasks and goals compared to other AI Agents that use the Terminal or CMD for interaction with the computer.
Furthermore the DAIA will be built with a built in memory, self evaluating and optimizing system from the start.
